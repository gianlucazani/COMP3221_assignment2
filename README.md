The assignment topic is the realization of a routing algorithm, running in a simulated local network composed of 10 nodes and at least 15 connections linking them with random cost. The network topology I used for running simulations is in the image above and the routing algorithm I used is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. <br>
